  about: >
    I'm Lysander, and this is my website. I'm a sophomore at Brooklyn Technical
    High School, aspiring to the Electrical Engineering major. I'm interested in
    low-level programming (operating systems, programming languages, game
    engines) and hardware design. My favorite school subjects are math and
    chemistry, which explains the projects I take part in.
