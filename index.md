# Who am I?
My name is Lysander Mealy. I am a high school student and an aspiring software
engineer. I work with many different languages and softwares in many different
fields. I mostly stick with low-level topics, because those interest me the
most. I am an open-source advocate, and 100% of my software (including this
website) is open source.

# What do I know?
I know many different languages, across many different paradigms, although my
main area of expertise is Rust. I have been using it for over two years now, and
have gained a deep understanding of the language, especially the unsafe and
unstable parts.

Despite this focus, I am proficient in many other languages, including:
- C
- C++
- C#
- Python
- Java
- JavaScript/TypeScript

I have experience in both front-end and back-end web and software development,
from design to product. I have worked with many different frameworks in many
different languages, and I am always open to learning more.

# What about non-coding?
Outside of coding, I have many other hobbies. On the electronics side of things,
I am very interested in electrical engineering, as well as digital CPU design.
In addition, I am a musician with experience with both piano and drums. I am
currently working on learning the guitar, but I'm not very good at it yet.

# What's on this website?
This website has descriptions of my [major projects](/projects), as well as a [blog](/blog) where I
share my thoughts on various topics.
